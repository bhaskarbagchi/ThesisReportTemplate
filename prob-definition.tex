\chapter{Problem Definition}

Given one or more  in the shopping cart the problem statement is to suggest items complementary to it which may contain garments or accessories which makes a complete set as per current fashion.

Physically speaking if someone adds a top in her shopping cart, we try to suggest her matching/complementary jeans, denim, skirt, bag, sunglasses, shoes, etc. which go well with the product chosen and make a complete set of items that can be used together.
