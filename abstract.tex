Recommendation Systems have now become ubiquitous to modern eCommerce. Most of the current research on recommendation systems focus on improving the speed and relevance of the recommendation. The aim of this project is to improve the relevance of recommended items with other items in the shopping cart. More specifically the work is on the problem which called \textit{Complete the Look}, where a complete set of garments and accessories which complement the items in the users' shopping cart and can be used together as a complete look is recommended. The recommendations will be in accordance to the current fashion trends. Here recommendation is reduced to a \textit{graph problem}. First an attribute vocabulary is built using annotated data, which is then used to train the co-occurrence graph of various clothes that can be worn together. The nearest neighbors of the items in the user's cart are recommended. Experiments are performed on a dataset of more than 500 user annotated street fashion images and the corresponding results are reported at the end of this paper.
