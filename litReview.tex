\chapter{Literature Review}

Research in visual fashion focuses on fashion parsing and retrieval of similar fashion images\cite{clothParsing}. These methods either use mixture of parts based pose estimators or use poselet part detector after applying the deformable parts based detector for person detector. Vast amount of existing literature also deal with learning aesthetically pleasing colors which can be helpful in the problem in our hand, but there are a very few papers which directly deal with \textit{complete the look}. Liu \textit{et al.}\cite{magicCloset} recommend clothes to wear for particular occasions. Here the user inputs the occasion like \textit{X-mas, romantic date} or \textit{family party} and clothes are suggested accordingly. They propose an SVM based formulation to handle both `wear properly' and `wear aesthetically' properties in the model. Iwata \textit{el at.}\cite{fashionCoordinates} study a similar problem of matching clothes recommendation and propose a topic model based approach. Jagadeesh \textit{et al.}\cite{visualReco} proposed using data driven approaches including Complementary Nearest Neighbour Consensus, Gaussian Mixture Models, Markov Chain-LDA and Texture Agnostic Retrieval. We propose a graph based approach to study the same problem and use textual tags as features instead of using visual features.
