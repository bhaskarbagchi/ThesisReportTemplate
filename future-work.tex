\chapter{Future Work}

This is a barebone implementation and there are many advancements still to be done in the proposed technique. Testing and evaluation has revealed that the granularity of the features should be increased for better results. The size of database should also be large so as to include many types of appearels. Out of vocabulary errors are yet to be dealt with. There are many things that can be done as an add on to improve both performance and quality of results, some of them are listed as follows.

\begin{itemize}

\item Features for representation of parts are to be improved by incorporating visual features. Inclusion of visual features will also include the analysis of features like color, texture, etc. which is expected to improve the quality of evaluation.

\item A feedback system can be added to the system as to increase edge weights to the features which are shopped together by users. This will be a self learning system and incorporate the changes in trending fashion all by itself.
