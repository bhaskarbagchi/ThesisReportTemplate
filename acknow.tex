This project would not have been possible without the guidance and patience of my guide Prof. Pabitra Mitra. Sir, you are an innovator of great thoughts and higher learning. You always ensured that I went above and beyond my potentials and showed me the value of thinking outside the bounds of all problems. The benefits of your advising went well beyond simply modelling and copying. I will forever benefit professionally and personally from your efforts during this project.

Thanks to my mother for her constant love and support and thanks to dad for being a wonderful role model. I would also take this opportunity to thank all the friends at IIT Kharagpur for being so wonderful. It was always a great relief to get out for lunch or a cup of coffee. I will never forget the memories and friendship developed here. I would specially thank \textit{Mandakinee Singh, Smriti Agrawal, Samidha Paroha and Shiwangi Shah} for their immense help during the evalution phase.

Most importantly I thank god for his faithful provision throughout my life.
