\chapter{Conclusion}

In this work we attempted to solve the Complete the Look Using the Street Fashion Images problem by reducing it to a graph problem and using structural similarity between objects instead of creating numeric feature vectors. It is very rarely observer that such problems are approached using textual features. The results obtained were satisfactory. Due to lack of evaluation methodology, only manual and subjective analysis of the results could be performed. Moreover our learning was that using textual features and structural similarity between objects can provide intuitive domain insights and perform satisfactorily for context based similarity and recommendation. The results obtained seemed to be best for 2 input queries in terms of precision and recall.
